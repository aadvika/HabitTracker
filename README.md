## Build habits that last.

Your life doesn't change from big actions taken, but from the underlying small steps and decisions taken everyday.

## Small changes lead to big changes.

This habit tracker is a simple web app that allows you to set goals for each week of the quarter and track your daily progress. This style of habit tracking is inspired from the **75 Hard** challenge that grew popular on social media. I have added my own spin onto the rigid structure of that challenge.

In this customized tracker, you can create three goals per week, and for each day, mark whether you’ve completed those goals. This way at the start of each week, you can set achievable, incremental goals catered to your routine. The habit tiles change color based on how many tasks you’ve completed that day, offering visual feedback to help track your progress. Research shows that watching your habits grow over time, day after day serves as an extra boost with staying consistent.

For this MVP version, 11 weeks (77 days) are represented for the duration of a quarter.

**Consistency > Motivation** <br/>

Show up even on the days you don't want to. Remember, it’s not about doing everything perfectly, but just showing up.

Let the small changes you take compound over time and bring you closer to the person you want to be!
